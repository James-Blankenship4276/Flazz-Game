Description:-

    This is a Flazz game. It shows questions like a quiz and after submitting the answer, it shows more information by changing
    the question into a text box of information. This game to test and increase your knowledge. It is just for entertainment.


How it works:-

    As you start the game, it will show the main menu with four options:
          Start Game  -   Directs you to the Start Menu.
          Make Quiz   -   Supposed to allow you to make your own quiz. for now it is not working properly.
          Settings    -   Directs you to the settings menu where you can change music settings.
          Quit        -   Exits successfully from the game.
          
    For instance, you choose "Start Game" option. It will take you to the "Start Menu".

    In "Start Menu", it will show you an option to choose "Categories". You can whatever category you want.
    
    After you are done choosing category, you have to click the "Start Quiz" button to start the quiz.

    As you start the quiz, it is supposed to show question/s and options for the answer. But we haven't fully implemented the
    database.
    
    At the end, it is s supposed to show the score with the options of "Main Menu" and "Exit". But, we haven't created the
    score page.
    
    The Settings menu have the option to "Mute" and "UnMute" the music.
    
    The game is also supposed to run a timer while playing quiz but there s no timer yet.


Trials and Tribulations:-

    We had great difficulty implementing database. The UML was somewhat difficult but more confusing. We didn't used any Design Patterns
    because they were difficult to implement and we both have difficulty implementing it since beginning of the semester. 
    
    
Bugs and Future Plans:-

    We have the sound bug. You can mute the music fron settings menu but, as soon as you go back, the music will turn on.
    Another bug is that if you hit the "x" at the top right of the window, it will close the window but, the program doesnt stop.
    You have to stop manually or use "Quit" option to stop the program.
    
    For the future, firstly we want the program to fully work to its basics. Then we want to implement more categories, then difficulty
    levels, some better graphics and keep things maintained and updated.
